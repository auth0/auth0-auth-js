## Get an access token for a connection

The `getAccessTokenForConnection` method allows you to exchange an access token for an access token for a specific connection. To use this method, you will need to instantiate the `ApiClient` with the client credentials:

```ts
import { ApiClient } from '@auth0/auth0-api-js';

const apiClient = new ApiClient({
  domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
  audience: '<AUTH0_AUDIENCE>',
  clientId: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
  clientSecret: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET>',
});

const tokenSet = await apiClient.getAccessTokenForConnection({
  connection: 'my-connection',
  accessToken: 'my-access-token',
  loginHint: 'login-hint', // Optional
});
```

The parameters for the `getAccessTokenForConnection` method are as follows:

- `connection`: The name of the connection to get the token for.
- `accessToken`: The access token used as the subject token to be exchanged.
- `loginHint` (optional): An optional login hint to pass to the connection.

If the exchange is successful, the method will return a `ConnectionTokenSet` object containing the following properties:

- `accessToken`: The access token issued by the connection.
- `scope`: The scope granted by the connection.
- `expiresAt`: The access token expiration time, represented in seconds since the Unix epoch.
- `connection`: The name of the connection the token was requested for.
- `loginHint`: An optional login hint that was passed during the exchange.
